# BERT_QuestionGeneration

This is an implementation of using BERT for question generation using PyTorch and the Huggingface Transformers library, based on this paper - "A Recurrent BERT-based Model for Question Generation" by Ying-Hong Chan and Yao-Chung Fan. Thanks to the authors for their work. 

Please note that this is a work in progress and full functionality hasn't been added yet.
